Adept protocol analysis
=======================
Trying to find a way to buy ebooks with Linux.

Since I'm on Linux, I can't use Adobe's Digital Editions software
that is required to decrypt the .epub files bought at nearly all ebook
stores.

To solve the problem, I'm trying to understand the network protocol used by
Digital Editions and implement it myself. In the end, I want to be able
to buy books online and read them on my ebook reader that does not support
Adobe's DRM, without using Windows and Digital Editions.




History

- Adobe has a Linux port of Digital Editions since 2007, but never
  released it:
